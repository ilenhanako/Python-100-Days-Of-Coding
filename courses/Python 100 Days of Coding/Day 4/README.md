# Day4: Randomisation and Python Lists

## Heads or Tails

* Generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails. e.g. 1 means Heads and 0 means Tails

## Who is Paying

* Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

## Treasure Map

* A program which will mark a spot with an X using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number.

* Lists start at index 0!
