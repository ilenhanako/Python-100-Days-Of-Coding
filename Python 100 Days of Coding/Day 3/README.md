# Day 3: Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code BLocks, Scope

## Odd or Even

* Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

* Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43. 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean. e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5. 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

* The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division. e.g. 6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder.

## BMI Calculator V2

* Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

* It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

  - Under 18.5 they are underweight
  - Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
  - Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
  - Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
  - Above 35 they are clinically obese.

* The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

* Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

## Leap Year

* Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

* This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year: for every year that is evenly divisible by 4 **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

## Pizza Order

* Build an automatic pizza order program which is based on a user's order to work out their final bill.

* Starting code containing the values of size and extras was supplied.

## Love Calculator

* Tests the compatibility between two people by calculating their "love score"

* METHOD: Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

* Thereafter give the results, accompanied by what the resulting numbers mean.
