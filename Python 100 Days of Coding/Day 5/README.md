# Day 5: For Loops, Range, Code Blocks

## Average Height

* Program that calculates the average student height from a list of heights. The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

* Important: do not use the sum() or len() functions - try to replicate their functionality using what you know about for loops.

## Highest Score

* Given numeric user inputs separated by commas, this program compares the individual score with the highest one.

* For in range loop used to store the highest score and display using f-string

## Adding Even Numbers

* A program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including 2 and 100.

* Only 1 print statement in console output - just the final total and not every step of the calculation.

* Use the range() function in the solution.

## Fizz Buzz

* This is popular interview test question based on a children's game.

* Effectively the program will print each number from 1 to 100 on a separate line ...

* However, when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

* But, when the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

* Also, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

## Password Generator

* A program to generate a random password consisting of letters, symbols and numbers based on user input.

* This gives the user control of how long the password will be and how many letters, symbols and numbers they want.
